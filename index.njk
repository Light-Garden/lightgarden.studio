        <h2 class="t-in th">We’re building the <strong>future</strong> of VR gaming</h2>
        <div class="body-content t-in t1">
            <p>Like many of our generation we grew up inspired by computer games and the engrossing worlds that captured our imaginations. The combination of absorbing narrative, engaging gameplay and rewarding progression kept us, along with millions of other players, coming back for more.</p>
            <p>We’ve always dreamed of stepping inside these worlds and not just experiencing them through screens and controllers. VR can put your eyes and ears into new places, but physically interacting with the world in any meaningful way is just not possible. Nothing exists that lives up to our dream of feeling like we are really there.</p>
            <p>So, in May ‘21, we founded Light Garden to turn these dreams into reality.</p>

        <div class="body-content t-in t1">
            <p><i>Presence: A full, uninterrupted sense of being somewhere else. Whereby all sensory, cognitive and psychological input is perfectly synchronised with your active and reactive expectations.</i></p>
            <p>We’re building a platform that represents the next step in the evolution of the virtual reality sector. By orchestrating all somatic, cerebral and subconscious stimuli into a coherent whole our groundbreaking platform enables you to travel beyond mere immersion to achieving and maintaining the VR holy grail: an uninterrupted sense of presence.</p>
            <p>No controllers. No tutorials. Just being there.</p>
