        <h2>We’re building the world’s most <strong>immersive entertainment</strong> destination.</h2>
        <div class="body-content">
            <p>Like many of our generation we grew up engrossed by computer games and the rich, captivating worlds they transported our imaginations to. The combination of absorbing narrative, engaging gameplay and rewarding progression systems kept us, along with millions of other players around the globe, coming back for more.</p>
            <p>We’ve always dreamed of actually stepping inside these worlds and not just experiencing them via screen and controller. And despite having tried an extensive array of brilliant VR Arcades, immersive theatre and “live” games, we haven’t found anything that lives up to our dreams.</p>
            <p>So, in May ‘21, we founded Light Garden to turn these dreams into reality.</p>
